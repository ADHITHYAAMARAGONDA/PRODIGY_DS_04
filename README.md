Sentiment Analysis and Visualization Project
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the process of analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. The analysis is performed on a sample dataset of social media posts, and the project uses sentiment analysis techniques to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral. The results are then visualized to reveal trends and insights. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and utilizes Python libraries for data manipulation, sentiment analysis, and data visualization.
